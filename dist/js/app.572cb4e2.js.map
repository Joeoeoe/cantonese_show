<p>早期粤剧脸谱比较简单，以黑白为基本谱式。勾画的特点是习惯把颜色涂至颈部，用灯芯草点画胡须，黑白脸谱喜用洗笔，即在勾脸时\r\n                    用笔涂画图纹之间的接壤处，使黑白两色之间增加一道灰色的过渡色层。</p>\r\n                <p>早期的粤剧脸谱，按行当可分为下列几种：</p>\r\n                <p>1. 大净脸谱：脸部基本上是涂一种颜色，如全棕黑色的包拯、全红色的关羽等，也有艺人称之为“整脸”或“全脸”。</p>\r\n                <p>2. 大花面脸谱：涂全白色，大多表现老奸巨猾、阴险毒辣的势要权奸，如董卓、曹操等人物。</p>\r\n                <p>3. 二花面脸谱：多数涂黑白两色，线条粗犷，黑白分明。多用来表现鲁莽率直、勇猛刚强的人物，如张飞、李逵等。</p>\r\n                <p>随着艺术交流活动的增加，粤剧艺人借鉴京剧脸谱的勾画技术，增加了红、黑、白三色的三块瓦脸谱、大红大绿的五色脸谱、神话人物\r\n                    的金银色脸谱等多种类型的谱式。</p>\r\n
